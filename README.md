# CGMC-XYZmodel

This code can be used to simulate quantum trajectories for the driven-dissipative XYZ Heisenberg model using a cluster Gutzwiller ansatz for the wave function. 
More information on this model can be found in arXiv:1812.00643

An example code can be found in TESTFILE.m for a specific set of system parameters.
